Fire is one of the most useful tools a bushcrafter can utilise. However, it is also a terribly dangerous one.

## What is Fire?
Fire is a chemical reaction between the oxygen in the air and a substance/fuel (in scientific terms, it is the rapid combustion of a fuel, often a hydrocarbon, in the presence of oxygen or other oxidiser.) Fire requires three components to exist:
- Heat
- Oxygen
- Fuel

If one of these items is removed, the reaction will stop. To successfully start a fire, all three components are needed. This is known as the fire triangle. More advanced bushcrafters might be familair with a fire tetrahedon or pyramid, which includes the continued chemcal reaction as another component.
